  title: Hello World!
  description: >
    I'm a fullstack developer with over 10 years professional experience
    developing software.  I hold a Master's degree in Software Engineering from
    Arizona State University. My roots are in enterprise-level Java application
    development. I see myself more as a generalist than a specialist in one
    technology/ framework. I'm experienced & comfortable with many current
    frontend, middleware, and backend technologies. Check out more about me in
    my the About Me page.

  I'm like so many other developers and love learning new (to me) technologies.
  Here's some of the stuff unrelated to my day-to-day development that I've been
  building lately.

        We sell green and roasted coffee beans that are sourced directly from
        independent farmers and farm cooperatives. We’re proud to offer a
        variety of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and
        local communities. Check our post or contact us directly for current
        availability.

        We offer a small, but carefully curated selection of brewing gear and
        tools for every taste and experience level. No matter if you roast your
        own beans or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget
        to fall in love with in our shop.

        Love a great cup of coffee, but never knew how to make one? Bought a
        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas
        to learn anything you want to know about coffee roasting and brewing.
        Email us or call the store for details.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.

  title: Hello World!
  point1: I'm a fullstack developer with over 10 years professional experience
          developing software. I have a Master's degree in Software Engineering from
          Arizona State University. 
  point2: My roots are in enterprise-level Java EE development, however I see 
          myself more as a generalist than I do as a specialist in any one technology.
  point3: I'm experienced & comfortable with many current frontend, middleware, 
          and backend technologies. You can find more about me and my dev 
          journey in my About Me page.

        Playing around with Hugo to deploy, using Firebase, a minimal porfolio and blogging website. I liked unique parts of 2 hugo themes so I decided combine them together to explore how Hugo worked to create the site I want.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
